# Shopping-List
# Madeline Ogilvie and Avonlea Hong
This program is a shopping list that allows users to add items, delete items, clear, sort, and view the list. Additional functions are counting the number of items, marking an item with a check, and quitting the program. To use the code, users type in the function they would like to use. Ex. "Add" to add an item to the list.

Add - When using this function, users will have to type in another item to place on the list. 

Delete - When using this function, users will have to type in one of the items they would like to delete. Ex. "oranges". Users must type the item exactly as it is shown on the Shopping List.

Mark - To use this function, users must time the item they would like to check. Ex. "cherries". Additionally, if you would like to delete a function that was previously marked as done, users will have to add the checkmark to the end of the item. 

Clear - This function will clear the entire list. 

View - Allows users to view the Shopping List. 

Count - Counts the number of items on the list and returns the number of items.

Quit - Allows users to quit the program.

Sort - Sorting occurs alphabetically, but will sort uppercase items first and then lowercase items.
